"You can't live on the edge all your life Faith, sooner or later, you'll have to jump"

## What is this?
This is a fan remake of the [Mirror's Edge](https://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/Mirrors_Edge/) parkour system in [S&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com), in the form of a custom gamemode.

## What's included?
- A close from-scratch remake of the Mirror's Edge movement
- Custom UI resembling the style of the original game

## Are you planning to port the entire game?
No, this is just a remake of the movement system.

## How do I run this?
*! Keep in mind that this is currently heavily in development. Please only consider playing this once a release is added to the repository. !*

Clone the repository, and import it as a game inside the S&box devtool GUI.

Please keep in mind that this gamemode is heavily in development, and will have a lot of issues that are in the process of being fixed. Expect daily updates.
